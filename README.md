# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Enjoy the classic Infocom adventure

## About 
Play this classic Infocom game from the [Interactive Fiction Archive](http://www.ifarchive.org/).  Peek into the history of gaming, experiencing some of the very earliest examples of interactive worlds using only text -- but this time using your voice!


### Original Infocom Description
![](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/hhgttg/front_th.jpg)

As the story begins, you are Arthur Dent, and a bulldozer is preparing to level your house even as an alien space fleet is preparing to level your planet. The incorrigible Mr. Adams has written new material and designed problems, especially for this interactive story. So grab a pint of bitter and a couple for the road and join Ford Prefect, Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin on a cosmic jaunt into the outer reaches where anything can -- and does -- happen. And don't forget your towel!

## Trivia

- While Douglas Adams originally wanted to program the game himself, he was paired with Steve Meretzky as Meretzky had more experience with the ZIL language and system.
- Adams' contributions mostly consisted of a series of conversations with Meretzky about puzzles, descriptions, and signing off on what was written.
- Meretzky said that Adams indicated he could not tell where his writing ended and Meretzky's began, a very high compliment.

## License and Source code

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/historicalsource/hitchhikersguide).  It is not considered to be under an open license.

As far as I know, Activision have still not declared the games abandonware. 

But I do not believe that it is in the spirit of copyright law that works of art drift into oblivion by unavailability. 
 
The day the games are republished in their old glory, I will gladly remove the files from this repository. Until then, I hope they will be allowed to remain here so you can have fun playing them in a novel way.
